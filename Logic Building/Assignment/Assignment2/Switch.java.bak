The error tells that double type expressions are not allowed in switch statements. 
There are only four types of data types allowed in switch case statements. They are 
char, short, int, and byte. Replace the double by int in the code.

The compiler is complaining about same values have been passed in both the cases 
due to which it is unable to decide the values to print.
