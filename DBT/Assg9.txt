Assignment – 9
Querying Multiple Tables at Once.

1) Write a query that lists each order number followed by the name of the customer who made the order.

SELECT o.onum, c.cname
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.cnum = c.cnum;


2) Write a query that gives the names of both the salesperson and the customer for each order along with the order number.

SELECT o.onum, c.cname, s.sname
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.cnum = c.cnum
JOIN salespeople s ON o.snum = s.snum;


3) Write a query that produces all customers serviced by salespeople with a commission above 12%. Output the customer’s name, the salesperson’s name, and the salesperson’s rate of commission.

SELECT c.cname, s.sname, s.comm
FROM customers c
JOIN salespeople s ON c.snum = s.snum
WHERE s.comm > 0.12;



4) Write a query that calculates the amount of the salesperson’s commission on each order by a customer with a rating above 100.

SELECT o.onum, c.cname, s.sname, (o.amt * s.comm) AS commission
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.cnum = c.cnum
JOIN salespeople s on o.snum=s.snum
WHERE c.rating > 100;
