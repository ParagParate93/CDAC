Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
*  In a DBMS, data is stored inside a file
*  Inside a file, rows are stored squentially
*  In DBMS, there is concept of the row numbering
*  In RDBMS table, is not a like that every row is a file
*  In RDBMS, rows of the table are not stored sequentially; they are stored in any specific order
*  Rows of the table are scattered (fragmentated) all over the DB
*  The reason why RDBMS does this to speed up the INSERT statement
*  In a multi-user environment, when multiple users are inserting rows in the same table simulteneously, if MySQL were to store the rows sequentially, then the INSERT operations would be very slow
* When you INSERT a table , wherever MySQL finds the free space in the DB Server HD, it will store row there
* When you select from a table, the order of the rows in the output depends on the row address; it will be in asending order of row address
* Once you INSERT a row, the row address is constant
* When you update a row, if the row length is increaing and the free space is not available, then the entire row is moved to some other address on the DB Server HD
* Later when you SELECT from the table, you may see that row at some other location
* Its only in the case of VARCHAR that the row length may increase or decrease
* Hence it is not possible to see the first 'N' rows of table, or the last 'N' rows of a table
* This is common for all RDBMS
* There is a system table which stores all the tablenames and their respective row addresses
* When you select from a table, MySQL will not search the entire DB Server HD; rather it will go to that system table, and retrieve the rows of the SELECTED table accordingly 

- Because the data is not saved in the order of insertion.
