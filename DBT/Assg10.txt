Joining a Table to Itself.

1) Write a query that produces all pairs of salespeople who are living in the same city. Exclude combinations of salespeople with themselves as well as duplicate rows with the order reversed.

SELECT s1.sname AS Salesperson_1, s2.sname AS Salesperson_2,s1.city FROM salespeople s1 JOIN salespeople s2 ON s1.city = s2.city
WHERE s1.snum < s2.snum;  -- Ensures no duplicates and excludes self-pairs


2) Write a query that produces the names and cities of all customers with the same rating as Hoffman.

SELECT c.cname, c.city FROM customers c
JOIN (SELECT rating FROM customers WHERE cname = 'Hoffman') AS h 
ON c.rating = h.rating;
